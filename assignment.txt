1) What will happen if the loop condition in a while loop is always True?
ans : The loop keeps executing repeatedly.

	The program never stops unless:
	You manually interrupt it (for example: Ctrl + C in terminal), or
	A break statement is used inside the loop, or
	The program crashes due to resource usage (CPU/memory).

		example :while True:
    				print("Hello")

2)  Can a for loop modify the sequence it is iterating over? What are the consequences?

ans : Yes, a for loop can modify the sequence it is iterating over, 
	but it may lead to skipped elements, unexpected behavior, or logical errors. 
It is safer to iterate over a copy or use alternative methods like list comprehensions.


3) ·      What is the output of a for loop with an else block when a break statement is executed?

ans :When a break statement is executed in a for loop, the else block is skipped and does not execute.

4)·      Is it possible to use a continue statement inside a while loop without causing an infinite loop?

ans : Yes, it is possible to use continue inside a while loop without causing an infinite loop, provided the loop control variable is updated properly before the continue statement.

5)❓ What happens if you modify the loop variable inside a for loop?

👉 Modifying the loop variable inside a for loop usually does NOT affect the loop iteration because Python takes the next value from the iterable automatically.

🔹 Example 1: Changing Loop Variable Has No Effect
for i in range(5):
    i = i + 2
    print(i)

Output:
2
3
4
5
6

Explanation:

range(5) produces values: 0,1,2,3,4

Even though i is modified inside the loop,

The next iteration still assigns the next value from range()

👉 The loop control is managed by the iterable, not by your reassignment.


6)❓ Can a while loop have multiple conditions? How are they evaluated?

👉 Yes, a while loop can have multiple conditions using logical operators like:

and

or

not

These conditions are evaluated as a Boolean expression.

✅ Example Using and
i = 1

while i <= 5 and i != 3:
    print(i)
    i += 1

Output:
1
2

Explanation:

Loop runs only if BOTH conditions are True:

i <= 5 ✅

i != 3 ✅

When i = 3, second condition becomes False → loop stops.

✅ Example Using or
i = 1

while i < 3 or i == 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1


👉 Loop runs if ANY ONE condition is True.

✅ Example Using not
i = 1

while not i > 3:
    print(i)
    i += 1

Output:
1
2
3

🧠 How Are Conditions Evaluated?

Python uses short-circuit evaluation:

✔ and Operator:

Stops checking if first condition is False

✔ or Operator:

Stops checking if first condition is True

📌 Interview Answer (Short)

Yes, a while loop can have multiple conditions combined using logical operators such as and, or, and not. These conditions are evaluated from left to right using short-circuit evaluation to determine whether the loop continues.


7)·      What happens if the iterable in a for loop is empty?

ans :If the iterable in a for loop is empty, the loop body is skipped and does not execute. If an else block is present, it will execute because the loop ends normally



8)·      Is it possible to nest a while loop inside a for loop and vice versa?

ans:📌 Interview Answer (Short)

Yes, it is possible to nest a while loop inside a for loop and a for loop inside a while loop. This is known as nested looping and is commonly used to handle multi-dimensional data or repeated tasks.

======================================================================================

1) Here is a simple Python program to print numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop:

✅ Program:
for i in range(1, 101):
    print(i)

🧠 Explanation:

range(1, 101)

Starts from 1

Ends at 100 (101 is excluded)

print(i) prints each number one by one.

Comparing two lists


2) Here’s a Python program to print even numbers between 1 and 50 using a while loop:

✅ Program:
num = 2  # Start from the first even number

while num <= 50:
    print(num)
    num += 2  # Increment by 2 to get the next even number

🧠 Explanation:

Start with num = 2 (the first even number).

Loop runs as long as num <= 50.

Print the current number.

Increment by 2 to move to the next even number.


3) Here’s a Python program to reverse a number using a while loop:

✅ Program:
# Take input from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Initialize variable to store reversed number
reversed_num = 0

# Temporary variable to manipulate the number
temp = num

while temp > 0:
    digit = temp % 10             # Get last digit
    reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit  # Append digit
    temp //= 10                   # Remove last digit

print("Reversed number of", num, "is", reversed_num)

🧠 How it Works:

% 10 extracts the last digit.

Multiply reversed_num by 10 and add the digit → appends it.

// 10 removes the last digit.

Repeat until the number becomes 0.

📌 Example:

Input: 1234
Output:

Reversed number of 1234 is 4321



4) Here’s a Python program to count the number of vowels in a given string:

✅ Program:
# Take input from user
text = input("Enter a string: ")

# Initialize vowel count
count = 0

# Define vowels
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"

# Loop through each character in the string
for char in text:
    if char in vowels:
        count += 1

print("Number of vowels in the string:", count)

🧠 How It Works:

Define a string vowels containing both lowercase and uppercase vowels.

Loop through each character in the input string.

Check if the character is in vowels.

If yes, increment the counter.

Print the final count.




5) Here’s a Python program to find the factorial of a number using a for loop:

✅ Program:
# Take input from user
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Initialize factorial
factorial = 1

# Loop from 1 to num
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    factorial *= i

print("Factorial of", num, "is", factorial)

🧠 How It Works:

Factorial of n is n! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n.

Initialize factorial = 1.

Multiply factorial with each number from 1 to num.

Print the result.
